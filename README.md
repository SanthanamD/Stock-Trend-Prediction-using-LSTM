# Stock-Trend-Prediction-using-LSTM
Process:
Data Collection: Collect historical stock price data for the company you want to predict stock prices. For this data should include the date, opening price, closing price, and volume of shares traded.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the data.

Data Preparation: Prepare the data for the LSTM model by splitting it into training and testing sets, and reshaping it into the appropriate shape for the input layer of the LSTM.

1.Model Building: Build the LSTM model using the Keras library in Python. You can start with a simple model with one LSTM layer and one dense output layer, and then experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

2.Model Training: Train the LSTM model on the training data using the .fit() method.

3.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data by comparing the predicted stock prices to the actual prices. You can use metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, or r-squared to evaluate the model's performance.

4.Model Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy the model to make predictions on new, unseen stock price data.

This project can be broken down into several sub-tasks and can be a great way to get hands-on experience with Time Series using LSTM and also learn how to work with real-world data. It also has a great practical use-case and can be used to predict stock prices of a company and predict the future market trends.
